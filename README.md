## About

Marvel Universe Characters is a web application designed to consume the Marvel API, allowing users to search and explore Marvel characters. The app requires user authentication to access character data, and it supports searching, pagination, and a detailed character view.

### Key Features:
- **User Authentication**: Allows users to log in using local storage.
- **Character Search**: Search for Marvel characters by name.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through multiple pages of characters.
- **Detailed Views**: Access more details about each character via individual pages.
- **Audio**: Background audio to enhance user experience.
- **State Management**: Uses `useContext`, `useReducer`, and `React Router` for routing and state management.
